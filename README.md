Welcome to the repository for the Electric Power System Masters course! This repository contains what you will need in order to learn about topics relevant to Assignment 1 and 2 in the course. In the folder **DigiLab** you will find six Jupyter Notebooks that will be utilized throughout the semester. These notebooks correspond to the lectures and are designed to enhance your understanding of the essential concepts in the course in a hands-on way.

## Topics Covered in the notebooks

Here are the topics that will be covered in the six notebooks:

1. **Python Fundamentals, Part 1**: Introduction to basic Python syntax and programming concepts.
2. **Python Fundamentals, Part 2**: Continued exploration of Python, focusing on more advanced programming techniques.
3. **Power Flow Calculations**: Detailed study of power flow calculations within the electrical grid.
4. **Security-constrained Power Flow**: In-depth exploration of security considerations in power flow.
5. **Unit Commitment**: Learning about unit commitment in power system operations.
6. **Economic Dispatch**: Understanding how to economically dispatch energy in the grid.

## Course Assignments

There will be two assignments related directly to the presented notebooks. These assignment are presented as notebooks, and you are required to fill in the missing code to complete the notebook.

## Getting Help

If you encounter any issues or have questions regarding the notebooks, feel free to reach out to the instructor or TA, or create an issue in the GitHub repository.
